              Prophetic Ruqyah was founded with a deep commitment to the rich heritage of Islamic spiritual healing. Inspired by the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), our journey began with the aim of reviving the ancient art of Ruqyahâ€”a practice that combines Quranic recitations, supplications, and spiritual guidance.
            </Typography>
            <Typography paragraph sx={{ color: '#4A5568' }}>
              We believe that true healing comes from a strong connection with faith, sincere prayer, and the compassionate support of a community.
